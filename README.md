# Student-Records-Management

💻 C-Based Mini Project


This is a terminal-based Student Records Management System built in the C programming language. It was developed as a final project for my programming course and includes over 3200 lines of code, written entirely by me. The goal of the project is to manage student information efficiently with a clean, interactive menu and structured modular code.
